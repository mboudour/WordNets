call him in the Piece Hall a stag
of ten; and I have heard from Brown. M. and Madame Vandenhuten and Jean
Baptiste talk of coming to see you next month. He mentions the Pelets
too; he says their domestic harmony is not the finest in the world, but
in business they are doing 'on ne peut mieux,' which circumstance
he concludes will be a sufficient consolation to both for any little
crosses in the affections. Why don't you invite the Pelets to ----shire,
Crimsworth? I should so like to see your first flame, Zoraide. Mistress,
don't be jealous, but he loved that lady to distraction; I know it for a
fact. Brown says she weighs twelve stones now; you see what you've
lost, Mr. Professor. Now, Monsieur and Madame, if you don't come to tea,
Victor and I will begin without you."
"Papa, come!"
